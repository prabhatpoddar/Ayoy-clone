                    <p>In basic terms, neurodiversity refers to the fact that we all think differently, and our brains function in different ways. Sometimes, this difference is clear to us, but other times it might be harder to detect or understand.</p>
                    <p>Neurodivergent individuals usually have a specific condition characterised by a cluster of behavioural or cognitive symptoms that impair ability to function ‘typically’ in society, whether that’s at home, in education, or in the workplace.</p>
                    <p>This is quite a simplistic understanding, though, and doesn’t account for the range of human experiences, individual differences, or the strengths of neurodivergent brains!</p>

                <p>This can be a tricky one for many people, but the answers are simple.</p>
                <p>A <b>person</b> can be neurodivergent, but not neurodiverse.</p>
                <p>A <b>group of people</b>, or a collective, can be neurodiverse, but not neurodivergent.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Neurodiverse is a term used to describe a group of people, or a collective, whose thinking is different from other people in that group.</p>
